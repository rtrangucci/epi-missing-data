## Instructions

Example code from https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08161

In R/simple-model-demo.R has code to:
- Simulate an ensemble of datasets from Model (10) in section 2.2 given PUMA data from Wayne County, MI
- Check the local identifiability conditions of the model
- Fit the inferential model to each dataset, potentially with different priors than were used to generate data
- Generate PDFs of model inferences for prior->posterior shrinkage vs. posterior z-score
